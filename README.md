Assign-USB-Flash-Disk-Drive-Letter
==================================

When a flash disk is inserted into a lab computer, it is automatically assigned the driveletter F:\. However, this causes problems as F:\ is already mapped to the student's network drive, meaning that the flash disk isn't assigned a valid handle in the logical disk manager. This application allows the user to change the drive letter assigned to the flash disk using a GUI interface.
